Fashion MNIST Definition
========================

- The original MNIST dataset has been used as testing dataset for a lot of learning
    methods for a long time, however:
    + It is too easy. With CNNs you can achieve a 99.7% of accuracy.
    + It has been overused.
    + It is not representative of the modern tasks.
- Therefore, the guys from Zalando have created a new dataset, 
    [FashionMNIST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07747) with similar 
    characteristics to MNIST:
    + 60000+10000 28x28 grayscale images and  10 classes
